# Sports News Crawler

A scalable, high-performance microservice designed to crawl, normalize, and distribute sports news articles from multiple external providers. Built with **Go** using **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**, this project emphasizes observability, reliability, and maintainability.

## 🚀 Overview

The Sports News Crawler automates the ingestion of news content. It fetches articles from configured providers, deduplicates them based on content hashing, persists them to MongoDB, and publishes new or updated articles to a Kafka topic for downstream consumption (e.g., by a CMS or notification service).

### Data Ingestion Flow

1.  **Fetch**: The crawler iterates through configured providers, handling pagination (both page-based and offset-based) to retrieve article batches.
2.  **Normalize**: Raw payloads are transformed into a unified `domain.Article` structure.
3.  **Deduplicate**: A SHA-256 hash is generated for each article. The system checks MongoDB to see if the hash has changed or if the article is new.
4.  **Persist**: New or updated articles are bulk-upserted into MongoDB.
5.  **Sync**: Successfully persisted articles are published to a Kafka topic.
6.  **Consume**: A separate service (or external consumers) listens to Kafka to sync data to downstream systems (e.g., CMS).

### Key Features

*   **Multi-Provider Support**: Concurrent crawling of multiple news sources using a worker pool pattern.
*   **Smart Deduplication**: Uses SHA-256 content hashing to detect duplicate articles and only process actual content changes.
*   **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between Domain (business logic), Application (orchestration), and Infrastructure (adapters).
*   **Observability First**:
    *   **Metrics**: Prometheus integration for tracking ingestion rates, errors, and latencies.
    *   **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry auto-instrumented tracing with Jaeger for visualizing requests spans.
    *   **Logs**: Structured JSON logging routed to Elasticsearch and visualized in Kibana.
    *   **Dashboards**: Pre-provisioned Grafana dashboards.
*   **Resilience**: Graceful shutdown, context-aware cancellation, and timeout management.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Implements a "continue-on-error" strategy for crawling loops, ensuring that partial failures in one batch (e.g., a single invalid article) do not stop the ingestion of subsequent pages, while still protecting against persistent outages via circuit breaking.
*   **Containerized**: Fully Docker-ized environment with Docker Compose for local development and Kubernetes manifests for deployment.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Language**: Go 1.24+
*   **Storage**: MongoDB
*   **Messaging**: Kafka (with Zookeeper)
*   **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Elasticsearch, Kibana (EFK Stack)
*   **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes (Manifests included)

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.24 or higher
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
*   [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SportsNewsCrawler/SportsNewsCrawler.git
    cd SportsNewsCrawler
    ```

2.  **Initialize Environment:**
    Create the `.env` file from the example.
    ```bash
    make init-env
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    make install
    ```

### Running Locally

The easiest way to run the entire stack (App, DB, Kafka, Observability tools) is via Docker Compose.

```bash
make dev
```

This command will start:
*   **App**: `http://localhost:8080`
*   **Mock Feed**: `http://localhost:8081` (Simulates external providers)
*   **Prometheus**: `http://localhost:9090`
*   **Grafana**: `http://localhost:3000` (User: `admin`, Pass: `admin`)
*   **Jaeger**: `http://localhost:16686`
*   **Kibana**: `http://localhost:5601`

To stop the environment:
```bash
make dev-down
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests
make test

# Run tests with race detection
make test-race

# Run linter
make lint
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The application is configured via environment variables. See `.env.example` for defaults.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PORT` | HTTP Server Port | `8080` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging Level (debug, info, warn, error) | `info` |
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB Connection String | `mongodb://localhost:27017` |
| `KAFKA_BROKERS` | Kafka Broker addresses | `localhost:9092` |
| `CRAWL_INTERVAL` | Duration between crawls | `2m` |

## 📊 Observability

### Metrics (Prometheus & Grafana)
The application exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`.
*   **Business Metrics**: `articles_ingested_total`, `articles_duplicates_skipped_total`.
*   **Runtime Metrics**: Go routines, GC duration, memory usage.

Access **Grafana** at http://localhost:3000 to view the "Sports News Crawler" dashboard.

### Tracing (Jaeger)
Distributed tracing is implemented using OpenTelemetry.
Access **Jaeger UI** at http://localhost:16686 to trace `processProvider` execution flows and debug latencies.

### Logs (Elasticsearch & Kibana)
Logs are written in JSON format and shipped to Elasticsearch via Filebeat (in Docker) or standard output (in K8s).
Access **Kibana** at http://localhost:5601 to search and analyze logs.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Docker
Build the Docker image:
```bash
make docker-build
```


## ⚖️ Design Decisions & Trade-offs

*   **Deduplication Strategy**: We generate a SHA-256 hash of the article's core content (Title, Body, Source, URL) to detect changes. This allows us to update existing articles if their content changes while ignoring redundant fetches, verifying data integrity without complex database lookups.
*   **Dual-Write Potential**: Currently, the service writes to MongoDB and then publishes to Kafka. In a partial failure scenario (DB success, Kafka fail), there could be inconsistency. A future improvement would be implementing the **Transactional Outbox Pattern** to guarantee specific eventual consistency.
*   **Concurrency**: A worker pool model is used to limit the number of concurrent processing routines, protecting system resources while allowing multiple providers to be crawled in parallel.
*   **Partial Failure Handling**: In a batch processing system, "poison pill" data can often halt an entire pipeline. We chose a robust approach where individual batch failures are logged (and counted) but do not immediately abort the crawl loop. A threshold for *consecutive* errors safeguards against total system failure (e.g., database down), balancing data completeness with operational safety.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

*   [ ] **Kubernetes Deployment**: Create `k8s` manifests (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap) to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster.
*   [ ] **Dynamic Configuration**: Move provider config to a database/API to allow adding sources without restarts.
*   [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-domain rate limiting to respect provider `robots.txt` and API limits.
*   [ ] **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**: Automated replay mechanisms for failed message publishing.
*   [ ] **Authentication**: Add API key or OAuth middleware for the admin endpoints.
